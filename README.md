 Code for Extermination Shock.

 This is the source for the game itself; assets are not included. Uses Irrlicht, Bullet3, OpenAL, and flecs to run properly.

 This repository doesn't include the assets for the game -- ideally, you would get those by actually owning the game -- but we wanted to make the source code public anyway so everyone can see our do's and don't's. Two years of work is a lot of work.

 The Bullet3 lib has also been deliberately left out; you'll need to grab and compile that from its own source code because the library is just goddamn huge and there's a ton of compilation options.
